----------------------------------

Installing WANDIO:

./bootstrap.sh (only if you've cloned the source from GitHub)
./configure
make
make install

The above series of commands will install wandio into /usr/local/lib. If
you wish to install to a non-standard location, append the
--prefix=DIR option to the ./configure command. ./configure also takes
a number of other options - run ./configure --help to view a comprehensive
list.

You may need to add the library location (e.g. /usr/local/lib) to your
/etc/ld.so.conf and run 'ldconfig' as root.
