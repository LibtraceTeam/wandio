This directory contains source code for WANDIO, a library for reading from, and
writing to, files. Depending on libraries available at compile time, WANDIO
provides transparent compression/decompression for the following formats:
 - zlib (gzip)
 - bzip2
 - lzo (write-only)
 - lzma
 - zstd
 - lz4
 - Intel QAT (write-only)
 - http (read-only)

WANDIO also improves IO performance by performing compression/decompression in a
separate thread (if pthreads are available).
